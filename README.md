# Introduction

I created this repository to have fun and practice with various NBA data. The Fantasy Draft repository is analysis of approaches that fantasy basketball managers can take toward picking the optimal team. I use Principal Component Analysis to determine good variables to use to measure how a plpayer performs which gives managers other statistics than fantasy points to draft their players by.

The Grizzlies Optimal Lineups repository analyzes every lineup that the Memphis Grizzlies have used during the 2020-2021 season and uses statistics like effective field goal percentage and plus/minus to determine which lineups are better for the team than others.
