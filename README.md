**IN PROGRESS**

# Introduction

I created this repository because I have relied heavily on "experts" year in and year out. This year, I thought about doing my own analysis using data from 2018-2020. Thus, I can make my own interpretations on what features are key to finding players that will perform well for my fantasy team and my motivating question revolves around this. What features impact a player's fantasy performance the most? Having found key features, I should be able to develop a well-rounded draft that is data driven and potentially choose a league-winning team. In this repository, I want to create my own data set, visualize features, and predict the features with highest importance for fantasy points.
