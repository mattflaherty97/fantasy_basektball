# [Memphis Grizzlies Lineup Analysis](https://github.com/mattflaherty97/fantasy_basketball/blob/main/grizzlies_lineups/test.md)

This post is my evaluation of the Memphis Grizzlies lineups through the 2020-2021 season thus far (as of 1/19/21). I use effective field goal percentage and plus/minus to evaluate each of the top 15 most popular lineups for the team. The file contains some html as I am not sure how to add a table to an .md with a function. Regardless, I get my point across and have some decent visualizations in the post as well. The folder with all necessary information is [here](https://github.com/mattflaherty97/fantasy_basketball/tree/main/grizzlies_lineups). There is a file with [R code](https://github.com/mattflaherty97/fantasy_basketball/blob/main/grizzlies_lineups/grizz_lineup_eFG.Rmd) as well as a file with the [html](https://github.com/mattflaherty97/fantasy_basketball/blob/main/grizzlies_lineups/grizz_lineup_eFG.html).

I will also include a few teaser tables that were of interest to me:
